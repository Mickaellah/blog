          My family's job
        </h2>
        <p>
          My father and my mother are both farmers, work in the <a href="rice-field.jpg">rice field</a> and farming some livestocks like pig, chicken to afford my younger siblings' study.My older brother whose name is <a href="edra.jpg">Edra</a> had already stopped his study to help my parents.Farmer is a really hard work but you do not earn lots of money because most of the people are farmers and do the same things and get the same products.

          We are four our parents' children, we are all one father and one mother. I have an older brother his name is Edra and after him me(my name is Clopedia)the third child is Fredicka my little brother and the last is Noelah our little sister.All of us are still young, the oldest is still 21 years old and not married yet.As I have already said before, he helps our parents.My younger siblings are studying in primary school and in secondary school so they still have a long way to go with their study.I try my best with my study at Onja and think about my own future life and also my family.

        <h2>
          Life without family
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am living far from my family because of my study, I have to live without them for the sake of my future and also theirs.It is really hard to live without family especially parents to teach you right from wrong and forbid  you from doing something wrong, I did not say that at Onja there is no one who can forbid you or teach you right from wrong but <b>parents are unique</b> and you do not have lots of them.I miss them all the time especially when I am sad or feeling lonely.
