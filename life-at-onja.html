          The place where we live.

        <p>
          We are 20 students study at Onja in <a href="mahanoro.jpg"><img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="Mahanoro"></a> which is in the east coast of Madagascar. In general life in Mahanoro is good but it is quite expensive. I love Mahanoro because it is still calm, but the only thing I am really afraid of is the serenity, it is not really good. There are some murderers in Mahanoro, last week there was a person who killed by murderers and until now the government couldn't find out who did it. We are still guests in Mahanoro, we rent houses in <a href="tropicana.jpg"><img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="Tropicana hotel"></a>, which is nearby the beach. It is really cool as you can see in the picture in the link above-mentioned in this paragraph.

          Relationship between students and all the staffs.

        <p>
          We are all from diffent regions, we all have our own way of speaking like (Betsimisaraka, Sihanaka, Merina, Betsileo, Tanosimboahangy, Bezanozano) but we have a really good relationship. We use English in our everyday life. Teachers are really friendly and cool, you can share your problems with them and they can give you solutions and students as well. Some people hate us because of us speak English, they do not think about what is the point for us to speak English. We have our goal that is why we use English.

          Relationship with other people like neighbour an churchmates.

        <p>
          Some people are really good especially the intelligent people and the elderly people.They are so good, it makes them happy to see young people from their country learning new things.Some of the people are really different from that especially young people, they are really jealous and unhappy to see you, when you pass next to them indeed you speak English,  they laugh at you and gossip after you. I think we should really change our mindsets, it is wrong that <strong>every one who speaks foreign language should live in a foreign country and every Malagasy who speaks foreign language are boasting.</strong> Everyone have their own goal about their future and also if you want to have communication with people from different world you have to know their language.
