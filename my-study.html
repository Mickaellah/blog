        When did it start and how did it go ?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Last year 07th, January 2019. I started to study English at Onja. It was really hard because English is not my
        first language. I am from Madagascar and I speak Malagasy.

        What happened during the year ?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first month we were struggling a lot and felt homesick as well because we are a long way from our home and
        we
        were not used to live far from our family. I leave with two of my classmates, they are so friendly and lovely
        girls. We have never fought untill now even though we are from three different villages and cultures.

        Every two months we were having a test, most of the time I failed, but I have never giving up on my study.There
        were few of the students gave up and went home, but I didn't because I don't have anything to do in my village.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were lots of difficulties and obstacles in the way to be an English speaker, but we overcame with that, we
        can speake English even if it was not fluently yet and we have passed A1, A2, B1 and B2 levels. It wasn't easy
        we
        strove hard to get those levels.

        them,

      </h2>
      <p>
        December 2019, we had a holiday and we went home to see our family. It was really good to see your family, your
        friends and your village again. we were so excited and happy. Most of the people were unhappy to see you again
        but
        yuor family were extremely happy. It was a great time even if it was short, I helped my family, went to the rice
        field and
        made some funs together, it was so good, enjoyable and memorable holiday. This is our village's picture, it
        is
        really good looking and nearby a river.
