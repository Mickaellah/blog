        <p>
          We are studying at Onja and there are three of us live in one house. We are renting a house but it is Onja who pays the money. My name is Clopedia and <a href="roomates.jpg"><img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="my roomates"></a> are Natacha and Prisca, we are all from different hometowns. I am from Andromba which is a small village in Ambatondrazaka region and Natacha as well from a village which is in the same region as me but it is far from our village, her village named as Andilanatoby. Prisca is from a different village and region which is Brickaville in Toamasina region, Toamasina is in the East coast of Madagascar. Both Natacha and Prisca are short if compared to me, we all have a dark complexion and we are quite thin.

            Our attitudes, behaviours and clothing.

        <p>
          As I have said before so we have different behaviour, for Prisca it is really different because she is used to live in the East coast. For them wearing short clothes are fine that is not mean that their behaviour is not good but have really different tradition. For us we don't really wear really short clothes but because of technology, people just wear it. Before, you can't see people wore short clothes but now you can see everywhere in the world.

            Our life at home.

        </header>
        <p>
          Our life is like everyone's life, when we have a problem, we ask solution from each other. There is no cultural conflict, sometimes we just do what we want to do and not bothering the others. There is no possession that we owned together at home except (bed, table, chair) we have our own life so that we will never fight about something like soaps are done or perfume is lost at home, we are all girl and we bought what's we need for our body, hair, etc.
